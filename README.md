# Apache Cassandra

Checkout the about.md file for information about Apache Cassandra. 
There is also an installation document, and an example.py python program.

Apache Cassandra is really well known for it's large scalability, which isn't something
that we are able to demonstrate. However, the example document is python interfacing with
Apache Cassandra to create a database, add data and query data in CQL.
